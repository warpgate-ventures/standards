# Tool versions

We prefer using [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to manage version
managers for Elixir, react and node.js projects.

You can copy and paste this and save it as `.tool-versions` in the same
directory of your new project.


```
erlang 22.2
elixir 1.9.4
nodejs 10.15.3
```

Afterwards, run `asdf install` to install the versions. Note that the version
numbers found in this markdown file will be constantly updated.
